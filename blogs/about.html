        Being a kid in India as I will describe myself would amaze you as much as I was after I started engaging and surfing on the internet. Generally a kid in India pursues his studies in a good private school in his city and being good at academics. teachers normally understand children but are stuck in the system's loop which prevents them a lot from improving a child on all levels. Exploring the world as a kid and enjoying is not in the curriculum of any kid here especially since the coaching thing has taken over. To me the pandemic of 2020 has improved my understanding of the world around me and has taught many lessons to learn and carry further. Parents are always supportive but any deviation from studies always carries trouble. My mother is an English teacher and my father is a businessman. 
        
        In India , Smartness or intelligence is always measured by the marks you get in school. If a kid doesn‚Äôt study or has poor grades , he is useless or not given attention. Well it is reasonable because EÃ∂dÃ∂uÃ∂cÃ∂aÃ∂tÃ∂iÃ∂oÃ∂n oops‚Ä¶ Studying and getting good marks is given the highest priority because it is the most secure way of getting a job and live a life with stability.
        
        But I have a vision , that is to enable the country and followed by the globe to be digitally literate. I want everyone to have the access to a device that can improve their life , Making it more productive. I think technology can change the world. Are you with me üëê ?
