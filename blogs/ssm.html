    <h1 style="color:black">Same-Sex Marriage case Supriya Chakraborty & Abhay Dang v. Union of India</h1>
    <hr>
    <div class="blog">

   

On November 14th, 2022, two same-sex couples filed writ petitions in the Supreme Court seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriages in India. The petitions were centered around the constitutionality of the Special Marriage Act, of 1954 (the Act).
<br><br>

I would sum up my take with: “They do have a cause, but they don’t have a case”<br><br>
Now before you call me homophobic, let me try to convince you.<br> I truly think that two consenting adults should live a life of dignity and freedom. But, petitioners claim that not allowing the legal recognition of same-sex marriage by the constitution is discriminatory based on Articles 19,21,24, etc. I will be unpacking each one by one but my central take would revolve around separation of powers. The purpose of this judicial review limits itself to counter injustices and inequalities petitioners claim to have and that the legislative bodies frame the laws. And if they do prove that the current constitution is unjust they take the W. However, allowing legal recognition to same-sex couples should only come through the law-making body called the legislative. The Special Marriage Act's intent and language were to recognize relationships between opposite sexes. It was derived from the personal laws of religions. No personal law has ever mentioned or allowed their positions on this issue. Courts, therefore, cannot give this a different interpretation. If a law has to be made, which I do support, must come through the bills passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.<br><br> When the petitions raise the question of changing the heteronormative attitudes, doesn’t society have a right of the agency to participate?

<br>Regular mentions of our constitution being a liberal one, democracy being a liberal one, does that mean that social conservatism has absolutely no place? Does it mean that society doesn’t have the right to draw a few red lines and say that thus far and no further? 
So when normative attitudes are sought to be revisited, To say that those who constitute the norm have absolutely no right to say, Is that the purpose of civil discourse? 
<br>
All religion and their personal laws are based on marriage between heterosexual couples, drawing from Hindu law that the purpose of marriage or the object of dampatya is to procreate. 
I could go on with telling specific lines from all religions and their mentions of the words man and woman. However, it is important not to misinterpret their intentions. When you say that gender definitions are fluid now, the framers didn’t once mention or clarify their views on this. And since you want this to change, I am with you, the 3% of India’s population who are homosexual, to bring about a change. But this change will only/ shall only be brought through a new law instead of amendments. Amendments will result in problems linking to all personal laws related to divorce, succession, etc. 

State not recognizing same-sex marriage is not a violation based on Article 15 it does not discriminate only on the basis of sex. Ie. It is not that two males would be allowed but two females won’t. 
This is also not a violation of the equality clause under article-14 as it doesn’t guarantee absolute equality and that this classification is a reasonable one. There is an intelligible differentia that differentiates heterosexuals from same-sex couples.
This is not a violation based on Article 19 because even if there is a right to form associations but there is no such provision that these will be recognized by the state.
They can also not rely on the Puttaswamy judgment which recognized the right to privacy because even though marriage is an individual affair, marriage as an institution in law has many statutory enactments related to divorce, adoption, maintenance, succession, etc. This was also accepted by CJI in the early days of the hearing. He gave an analogy that the parents do have a right to their son, but not an absolute one, the state can interfere in several matters like education. 
I will keep editing this article based on your feedback. So, you are welcome to engage.
